compute_gt_from_credits: computes g(t) based on the default information contained in the default_events folder. The g(t) function is saved in the gt_from_credits folder.\\
sim_defaults_via_copulas: computes g(t) using different copula functions. The g(t) function is saved in the gt_from_copulas folder.\\
plot_gt_from_credits: allows you to plot the g(t) obtained from credits in a single graph. This graph is saved in the graph folder.\\
plot_gt_from_copulas: allows you to plot the g(t) obtained via copula simulations in a single graph. This graph is saved in the graph folder.\\
